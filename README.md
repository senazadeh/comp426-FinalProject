# comp426-FinalProject

The 426 Final Fair Festival Project


Welcome, welcome! You've made it. This is the rubric for the final project. Step one is complete, now you must prepare to be inspired to embark on your journey of conquering the web! If not the whole web, then maybe just a small web of classmates? Who's to say.

This year’s final project will be to independently design, build, deploy, and present a website completely of your own choosing. The goal of this project is simple: make something magnificent. Make something that you would be proud to show off. Make something to send to that ne'er-do-well business person on LinkedIn who asks if you can "program the web". Make something to blow us away. Is that too much to ask?

There is a set of achievements listed below. Some portion of them will require completion in order to even make an appearance at the Final Fair Festival (you have to have at least made a project). All, however, are optional and may be unlocked to reach your desired grade. However, unlocking achievements alone won't be enough for the top grades in the class. For that, you must not only impress the judges but also your peers! This means the final portion of your project grade is for you to be the judge and jury for your peers’ creations at the end of the semester. Unfortunately, the executioner is still the course staff, so we will have a final say in the grade as well. This comes with the small stipulation that points from achievements will be capped at 90 (5 for showing up and grading, 5 for how you are graded). Besides that, the world is your oyste... Website!

*independently: This year’s project is an individual project. Sorry about that, we feel it easier with covid making group work difficult. 

*deploy: Make your project last! Host the frontend on GitHub and if you are making a full-stack app find a server provider. 

*present: Part of the deal with these final projects is that you will be presenting at the final project expo. This can take many forms, be creative! 

Achievements
Unlock as many as you like. Your point cap is set to 90 (which will ensure 90/100 of the final grade points), so anything above that will just be a safety net in case one of your unlocks is deemed invalid or insufficient.
